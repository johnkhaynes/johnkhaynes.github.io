David Sparks, aka [MacSparky](https://www.macsparky.com), recently sent out this email to his mailing list:

> Hi John,
> 
> I tore through Isaac Asimov’s _Foundation_ series when I was about twelve. At first, I assumed the story would follow Hari Seldon, the brilliant mathematician who kicks off the series by predicting the collapse and rebirth of galactic civilization. Twelve-year-old me loved Hari, and I couldn't wait to see his story unfold.
>
> Then the books leapt forward … by centuries. Seldon slipped from living legend to myth, from myth to footnote, and finally into near‑obscurity. Part of my twelve-year-old self was offended by that. I’d been invested in Hari, and how could he become so obscure? Underneath it all, I was grappling with something: If even Hari Seldon—a towering hero—could vanish into the background noise of history, what chance did I have of leaving a mark?
>
> After my twelve-year-old brain processed this, I surprisingly didn’t find the thought depressing. I found it freeing. The futility of chasing an eternal legacy felt like permission to let go. The real point, my twelve‑year‑old self decided (and my adult self still believes), is to live fully in the sliver of time we’re given—to savor our brief window of human experience rather than worry about being remembered forever. That little epiphany has stayed with me.
>
> That insight became an internal compass. When I start taking myself too seriously, it nudges me back into alignment. By now, it’s so ingrained that I seldom notice it, yet it quietly shapes my decisions and my ability to live in the moment.
>
> It colors my work as well. I don’t expect any Field Guide I write to alter the course of humanity, but I **can** help real people, right now, who face the same messy challenges I do. There’s a quiet nobility in that: sharing what I’ve learned, offering what might help, and trusting readers to judge its value.
>
> Recognition is nice, but I try not to clutch it. Anything I build stands on the shoulders of others, and I’m happy to spread credit around. If someone finds my work useful, that’s enough. After all, in just a few generations I'll be much less remembered than Hari Seldon, and that's okay.
>
> Looking back, that early revelation about impermanence was probably my first real philosophical insight. Not a bad takeaway for a twelve‑year‑old.
>
> Your pal, David

I couldn't help but read between the lines of this message -- it feels like there's a clear subtext here. Are we *all* about to become irrelevant? And if so, what do we do about it? If AI/AGI/ASI can do everything a human can do and more, what are we supposed to do with that? It's interesting to me that MacSparky reflects on this question from the perspective of Asimov's *Foundation* series, which doesn't exactly paint a utopian vision of the future. 

I love MacSparky's response to this implied question: let's do what we can to help each other in the face of what's coming, to create useful things, and ultimately we'll do best if we stay focused on the present and not cling to old ideas about who we are and our ultimate place in the world. As MacSparky points out, there's actually something kind of freeing about letting ourselves off the hook of being remembered forever, and instead we can turn and embrace the one inarguable universal certainty: none of us can know the future.
