A blog? Now? Really? 

Why would I take this moment to start an old-fashioned and antiquated blog right
as we're staring down the barrell of a radical ditigial transformaion that will
change our world forever? The short answer: Plato. Through the voice of
Socrates, Plato did what we as humans always do. He wrestled with the big
questions, seemingly without finding any firm footing or definitive place to
stand, but somehow through this process of grappling with these hard questions
something resembling wisdom emerges. And just as Plato was tranformed by this
process, we are also transformed reading his words thousands of years later.
Call it the muse, or being touched by the divine spark, or the converational
nature of reality - all of these things point at the same thing. 

There's a deeper underlying reality that we sense but can't get our mind and
hands around. We struggle with glimpsing it and this process feels futile, and
any firm ground we find feels fleeting. But somehow, mysteriously and magically,
we are transformed in the process.
